# Portsmouth Climate Action brand assets

The _Portsmouth Climate Action_ brand comprises a symbol and the name set in the **Playfair Display Black** font. The symbol may be used on its own or alongside the name.

- The master file for all the logo variants described below is an Adobe Illustrator 2020 compatible file. You can find it at `/src/pca-logo-master.ai`.
    - Variants for use in print can be derived from this file or requested – e.g. `eps` or `pdf` format.
- The variants themselves are at `/assets/logos`.
- The **recommended social media logo variant** is at `/assets/logos/png/symbol-only/pca-for-circle_neg.png`.
    - It places the symbol only on a `pca-blue` background, sized to allow for circular masking.

## Font

Playfair Display

- From the designer, Claus Eggers Sørensen: [Playfair 2.0](https://forthehearts.net/playfair2_0/)
- From [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair+display)

## Logo colour variants and backgrounds

- The preferred use of the logo variants is ‘reversed out of’ a _dark_ background: **neg** elements.
- Variants are available for use on a _white or light_ background: **pos** elements.
- All of the logo variants _except for `pca-for-circle_neg.png`_ have a transparent background.

## Logo arrangement variants

The logo elements are available as:

- `symbol`: symbol only, tightly cropped: 
- `for-circle`: symbol only, for use in a circle:
    - The assumption is that the social media platform where the logo is deployed will apply a circle mask to it
- `linear`: symbol + name in a single line
- `2-line`: aymbol + name in two lines

## Logo file format variants

The variants are available as:

- `svg` is the preferred format for use online when that format is supported, but this will not be the case for social media platforms so…
- `png` should be used when a raster (pixel-based) image is needed
    - See above for recommended social media use.
